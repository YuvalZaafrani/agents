My name is Yuval Zaafrani, an **Automation QA Engineer and a B.Sc. Computer Science & Entrepreneurship student at Reichman University.**
Based in Tel Aviv, I am passionate about technology, innovation, and creating real impact by bridging technical expertise with entrepreneurial vision.  
In my current role at Nayax, I develop and maintain automation frameworks, leveraging Python, API testing, and CI/CD to deliver high-quality,
reliable software solutions. My academic journey further strengthens my foundation in computer science, data structures, operating systems,
and machine learning, while also cultivating business acumen in product management, venture capital, and digital marketing.  
Beyond the tech and entrepreneurial world, I draw inspiration from creativity. 
I enjoy exploring new cuisines and experimenting in the kitchen, where I blend precision with innovation. Music and sports also play a key role in my life â€“ I love playing the piano and staying active as ways to recharge and stay balanced.  
I am driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to contribute to meaningful projects that connect technology and people.
