The chosen company for investment is Perplexity AI.

Reasons for Choosing Perplexity AI:
- **Market Position**: Perplexity AI is rapidly growing within the AI industry, primarily due to its innovative AI-based search tool that directly competes with industry giants like OpenAI and Google.
- **Future Outlook**: The company is well-positioned for significant growth, with plans to expand its product offerings and user base. The increasing demand for advanced AI solutions supports a positive growth trajectory.
- **Investment Potential**: Backed by major investors such as SoftBank, Nvidia, and figures like Jeff Bezos, the company displays high potential through significant funding and strategically advantageous positions within the industry.

Companies Not Selected:
- **Beehiiv**: Although Beehiiv is experiencing substantial growth in the creator economy, mainly due to increased demand for personalized content and newsletter platforms, its overall market potential does not match that of Perplexity AI. While it proposes attractive early investment opportunities, it lacks the level of strategic backing observed in Perplexity AI.
  
- **Cohere**: Cohere has been recognized for its development of natural language processing and AI solutions and is making significant partnerships. However, despite its promising investment potential due to recent substantial funding, its market position and future outlook, especially in enterprise AI, do not present as robust an investment opportunity as Perplexity AI.

In conclusion, Perplexity AI's innovative edge, significant backing from notable investors, and strategic market positioning make it the strongest candidate for investment compared to Beehiiv and Cohere.
